2.Write commands to start, stop and restart a systems service called "cronListener":
	To start the service: sudo systemctl start cronListener
	To Stop the service: sudo systemctl stop cronListener
	To Restart the service : sudo systemctl restart ronListener


3. Suppose we save logs for a service called cronListener in a file called cron.logs. Write a bash command which reads the last 200 lines of the log file.
	tail -n 200 cron.logs
